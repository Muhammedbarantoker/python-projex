# python-projex
A collection of Python projects and exercises from beginner to advanced levels.

This repository contains some of my personal Python exercises and small scripts.  
I am currently learning Python and slowly uploading the things I practice.

The files start from very basic topics such as print statements, variables, data types, if-else conditions, loops, and simple functions.

Over time, I plan to add more examples and small projects as I learn more.

This repository is mainly for learning and sharing. I hope it may help others who are also getting started with Python.
